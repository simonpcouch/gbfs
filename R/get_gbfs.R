#' Get dataframe of bikeshare feeds released by a city
#'
#' @description Of the different types of feeds supplied by the gbfs,
#' some are required, some are conditionally required, and some are
#' optional. This function grabs a list of each of the feeds supplied
#' by a given city, as well as the URLs to access them.
#' 
#' @param city A character string that can be matched to a gbfs feed. The recommended
#' argument is a system ID supplied in the output of [get_gbfs_cities()], but will
#' also attempt to match to the URL of an active .json feed or city name.
#'
#' @return A \code{data.frame} containing the feeds supplied by
#' a city. . The `feed` column supplies the name of the relevant .json feeds, 
#' while the entries in the `URL` column supply the feeds themselves.

#' Grab bikeshare data
#' 
#' \code{get_gbfs} grabs bikeshare data supplied in the General Bikeshare 
#' Feed Specification format for a given city. By default, the function returns
#' the results as a named list of dataframes, but to make accumulation of
#' datasets over time straightforward, the user can also save the results
#' as .Rds files that will be automatically row-binded.
#'  Metadata for each dataset can be found at:
#' \url{https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md}
#' 
#' @param city A character string that can be matched to a city or a url to an 
#' active gbfs.json feed. See \code{get_gbfs_cities} for a current list of available cities.
#' @param feeds Optional. A character string specifying which feeds should be saved. 
#' Options are \code{"all"}, \code{"static"}, and \code{"dynamic"}.
#' @param directory Optional. Path to a folder (or folder to be created) where 
#' the feed will will be saved. 
#' @param output Optional. The type of output method. By default, output method 
#' will be inferred from the \code{directory} argument. If \code{output = "save"}, 
#' the dataframes will be saved as .rds objects in the given folder. If 
#' \code{output = "return"}, the results will be returned as a named list of 
#' dataframes. Setting \code{output = "both"} will do both. If both are left
#' as NULL, the result will be returned and not saved to file.
#' @return The output of this function depends on the arguments supplied to 
#' \code{output} and \code{directory}. Either a folder of .rds dataframes saved
#' at the given path, a returned named list of dataframes, or both.
#' The function will raise an error if the \code{directory} and \code{output} 
#' arguments seem to conflict.

\usage{
get_system_calendar(
  city,
  directory = NULL,
  file = "system_calendar.rds",
  output = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{city}{A character string that can be matched to a gbfs feed. The recommended
argument is a system ID supplied in the output of [get_gbfs_cities()], but will
also attempt to match to the URL of an active .json feed or city name.}

\item{directory}{Optional. Path to a folder (or folder to be 
created) where the feed will be saved.}

\item{file}{Optional. The name of the file to be saved (if \code{output} 
is set to \code{"save"} or \code{"both"}), as a character string. 
Must end in \code{".rds"}.}

\item{output}{Optional. The type of output method. If left as default, this
argument is inferred from the \code{directory} argument. If 
\code{output = "save"}, the object will be saved as an .rds object at 
# the given path. If \code{output = "return"}, the output will be returned 
as a dataframe object. Setting \code{output = "both"} will do both.}
}
\value{
The output of this function depends on argument to \code{output}
and \code{directory}. Either a saved .rds object generated from the current 
feed, a dataframe object, or both.
